# Matrix Operations Tool

## Overview
This project is a **Matrix Operations Tool** developed in Java for a university project. The tool is capable of performing key matrix operations, including finding the determinant of a matrix and multiplying matrices.

## Features
- **Determinant Calculation**: Efficiently calculates the determinant of square matrices.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices of compatible dimensions.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Accepts matrix input from the user via the console or through predefined matrix data in the code.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid matrix dimensions and other common errors gracefully.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used to implement the matrix operations.
- **Java Collections Framework**: Utilized for managing matrix data structures and performing operations.


## Usage
- **Determinant Calculation**: Input a square matrix (e.g., 2x2, 3x3) to calculate its determinant.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Input two matrices of compatible dimensions to obtain their product.

### Example
For a matrix multiplication example:

1. Input Matrix A (e.g., 2x3):
    ```
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    ```

2. Input Matrix B (e.g., 3x2):
    ```
    7 8
    9 10
    11 12
    ```

3. The output will be the resulting 2x2 matrix from multiplying A and B:
    ```
    58  64
    139 154
    ```

For determinant calculation:

1. Input a square matrix (e.g., 3x3):
    ```
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
    ```

2. The output will be the determinant value:
    ```
    Determinant: 0
    ```
